General Overview: 
This project implements three distinct AI-based bots to solve Wordle puzzles, each leveraging a different algorithmic approach:

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Bot

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Bot

Bayesian Network Bot

Each bot is designed to autonomously play Wordle using a list of past solutions, simulating and displaying the solving process, performance statistics, and average guesses per solve.

For stats and official wordle bots, navigate to wordle_project directoryâ€“contains README that explains running and refinements

Features:
Automatically solves Wordle puzzles using different AI principles

Logs performance metrics such as:

- Number of words solved

- Average number of turns per solution
  
- Solving Process and Used Guesses

Modular and extensible design for adding additional solving strategies

Easy to run with separate folders and entry scripts for each bot. Each bot's driver file can be adapted easily to solve current wordles with an above average accuracy and solve rate. 


Bot Descriptions: 

Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) Bot
Uses simulation-based search and exploration vs. exploitation strategies to decide the next best word.

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) Bot
Applies constraint propagation and letter-position inference to systematically narrow down valid word candidates.

Bayesian Network Bot
Builds probabilistic models to update word likelihoods based on feedback from guesses.

How to Run: 

Each bot has its own folder and a dedicated entry script. To run, navigate to each folder and simply do python run_bot.py
The MCTS bot folder and the Bayesian bot folders both contain prev versions of the bots that are more buggy/less efficent, kept it there as reference
Refined versions of all bots are in wordle_project/src, and to get stats over 1000 sampled past wordle answers, just do test_framwork.py (follow readme directions in folder)

Future Improvements: 

- Add user interface for interactive solving

- Train bots on broader word distributions

- Introduce reinforcement learning for adaptive guessing
