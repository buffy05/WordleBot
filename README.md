# WordleBot
Need to do: 

    1. Compile list of previous literature/work/research done on optimal wordle-solving algorithms
    
    2. Obtain list of five-letter words (doesn't have to be exact to word bank that NYT uses, but should be close)
    
    3. Make wordle playing interface using python (not ai itself, but will simulate the game)
    
    4. Make first wordle bot algorithm using Monte Carlo Search Tree 
    
    5. (if feasible) make second and third world bot algorithms using different methods (entropy-based, etc.)
    
    6. Compare efficency, runtime, how many turns each algorithm takes to solve wordle
